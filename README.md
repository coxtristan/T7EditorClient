# Description
This the the client component for the T7LuaEditor. It transmits UI model data to the editer through localhost and provides the Lua C API needed to do so from a Bo3 mod. This will allow us to do real-time side-by-side emulation of the game running the hud in the editor, allowing for users to iterate on their HUD animations and deisgn at breakneck speed compared to the time it used to take.
